# Mohit's Portfolio

This is a portfolio page that I worked up while being bored in class, and decided to turn it into a full portfolio website.

## Technologies used

As you normally would for any other Next.js application:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the `dev` script

## Contributing

Why would you?
